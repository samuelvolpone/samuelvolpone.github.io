I'm  Samuel Volpone, recent graduate of the University of New Hampshire. I grew up in northern Massachusetts and seacoast New Hampshire. I graduated in September of 2023 with a Bachelors in Business Administration - Finance, as well as Business Administration - Information Systems and Business Analytics. If all goes well, I will also be acquiring my Master of Science in Business Analytics this September. This past year was intense to say the least, but I look forward to joining the workforce!

Outside of work/school I enjoy a few hobbies in the outdoors like hiking, surfing, as well as playing basketball. Im currently have 20 mountains left in the 48 4000 foot peaks in New Hampshire!
